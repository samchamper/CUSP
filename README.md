# CUSP
### A CUDA Utilizing Simulation of Populations
#### Author: Sam Champer
##### Prepared for UO CIS 441: Graphics

A simple population simulator that utilizes Nvidia's CUDA platform to parallelize individual interaction.

This project contains several sub-project iterations:

1. cpu_version: This version just uses the CPU to calculate the simulation interactions.
    Frame by frame image output is generated by VTK. This project includes CMAKE files to build,
    though the cmakelists file may need to be altered for use on non-windows platforms.
1. cpu_gl_version: This version just uses the CPU to calculate the simulation interactions.
    The simulation can then rendered in 3d in OpenGL or exported to text files containing the population data.
    This project also includes CMAKE files to build.
1. CUSP: This primary target of this project. Uses CUDA to allow the GPU to perform the time consuming operations,
    and then renders the results in 3d in OpenGL or exports data to text files. This project only includes files
    for building using Visual Studio, and may have not yet resolved portability issues.

    
##### Notes
* The text files with exported population data can be read and turned into mp4 for
    visualization using a separate project located here: https://github.com/samchamper/slim_vis
